This assignment is to utilize your knowledge about clustering algorithms and how to assess the qualkity of clustering.  Download the data from here [k_cluster_data_with_cluster.csv Download k_cluster_data_with_cluster.csv].  The data has 450 samples and four columns (sample_id, X, Y and cluster), and these are two-dimensional data (X, Y) generated from four different groups (clusters). 

[20] Using the data downloaded, cluster the samples (X, Y) via k-means clustering algorithm with k = 4. Once all the samples are assigned to a cluster, cj 
 {1, 2, 3, 4},
compute silhouette score for each sample and average silhouette width for the clustering results.
compute entropy as defined in the lecture notes.
[60] Using the same data set, cluster the samples via hierarchical clustering with the single linkage, the average linkage, and the complete linkage. For each clustering result,
compute silhouette score for each sample and average silhouette width.
compute entropy as defined in the lecture notes.
[20] Determine which clustering result is the best based on the average silhouette widths and entropies computed above.  Justify your answers.
